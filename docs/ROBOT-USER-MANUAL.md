# Robot User Manual
This document defines how the robot should be operated in different scenarios.

## Operator Controls

### Elevator

All elevator setpoints are affected by whether the robot is in **hatch mode** or **cargo mode**.
Depending on the mode, the elevator buttons will either move the elevator to the top, middle, and bottom **hatch** ports,
or the top, middle, and bottom **cargo** ports. Note that the button **must** be held in order for the elevator to continue moving to that setpoint.
One button is always elevator to ground, regardless of mode.
The elevator can also be controlled manually with a joystick.
